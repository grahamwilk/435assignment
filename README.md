## RAD
We will create a Discussion forum application.

Endpoints:
1) /create will create posts which will be stored using block storage via S3. Posts will have a post ID and text. 
2) /delete will delete posts with the same post ID
3) /login will log in users based on username and password

We will use Tkinter to create the front end.
